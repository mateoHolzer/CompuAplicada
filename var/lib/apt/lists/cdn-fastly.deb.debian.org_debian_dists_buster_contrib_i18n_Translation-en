Package: anbox
Description-md5: 2cf24869b7c28429da5987f75987875f
Description-en: Android in a box
 Anbox is a container-based approach to boot a full Android system on a
 regular GNU/Linux system.
 .
 In other words: Anbox will let you run Android on your Linux system
 without the slowness of virtualization.
 .
 Anbox uses Linux namespaces (user, pid, uts, net, mount, ipc) to run a
 full Android system in a container and provide Android applications on any
 GNU/Linux-based platform.
 .
 The Android inside the container has no direct access to any hardware. All
 hardware access is going through the anbox daemon on the host. It reuses
 what Android implemented within the QEMU-based emulator for OpenGL ES
 accelerated rendering. The Android system inside the container uses
 different pipes to communicate with the host system and sends all hardware
 access commands through these.
 .
 This package needs Android kernel modules and rootfs image, see
 /usr/share/doc/anbox/README.Debian for information.

Package: dynare-matlab
Description-md5: 90e8fcabb135fcf60e09f0be51774946
Description-en: MATLAB support for Dynare
 Dynare is a software platform for handling a wide class of economic models, in
 particular dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) and overlapping
 generations (OLG) models. The models solved by Dynare include those relying on
 the rational expectations hypothesis, wherein agents form their expectations
 about the future in a way consistent with the model. But Dynare is also able
 to handle models where expectations are formed differently: on one extreme,
 models where agents perfectly anticipate the future; on the other extreme,
 models where agents have limited rationality or imperfect knowledge of the
 state of the economy and, hence, form their expectations through a learning
 process. In terms of types of agents, models solved by Dynare can incorporate
 consumers, productive firms, governments, monetary authorities, investors and
 financial intermediaries. Some degree of heterogeneity can be achieved by
 including several distinct classes of agents in each of the aforementioned
 agent categories.
 .
 Dynare offers a user-friendly and intuitive way of describing these models. It
 is able to perform simulations of the model given a calibration of the model
 parameters and is also able to estimate these parameters given a dataset. In
 practice, the user will write a text file containing the list of model
 variables, the dynamic equations linking these variables together, the
 computing tasks to be performed and the desired graphical or numerical
 outputs.
 .
 This package is only useful to users having MATLAB installed on their
 machine. It contains the source of the MEX files and will recompile them using
 the existing MATLAB installation.

 started by a special launcher script that will create symbolic
 links or do other setup. This package contains those launcher
 scripts.
 .
 The following games currently require this package:
 .
  * Doom 2: The Master Levels
  * Quake series
  * Unreal
  * Unreal Gold

Description-en: Python 3 module to access Nvidia‘s CUDA parallel computation API
 PyCUDA lets you access Nvidia‘s CUDA parallel computation API from Python.
 Several wrappers of the CUDA API already exist–so what’s so special about
 PyCUDA?
  * Object cleanup tied to lifetime of objects. This idiom, often called
    RAII in C++, makes it much easier to write correct, leak- and crash-free
    code.  PyCUDA knows about dependencies, too, so (for example) it won’t
    detach from a context before all memory allocated in it is also freed.
  * Convenience. Abstractions like pycuda.driver.SourceModule and
    pycuda.gpuarray.GPUArray make CUDA programming even more convenient than
    with Nvidia’s C-based runtime.
  * Completeness. PyCUDA puts the full power of CUDA’s driver API at your
    disposal, if you wish.
  * Automatic Error Checking. All CUDA errors are automatically translated
    into Python exceptions.
  * Speed. PyCUDA’s base layer is written in C++, so all the niceties
    above are virtually free.
  * Helpful Documentation.
 .
 This package contains Python 3 modules.

Package: repo
Description-md5: 1496a967d4bcbc0d6ebc3348869abf22
Description-en: repository management tool built on top of git
 Repo is a repository management tool that the Android developers built on top
 of Git. Repo unifies the many Git repositories when necessary, does the
 uploads to the Android revision control system, and automates parts of the
 Android development workflow. Repo is not meant to replace Git, only to make
 it easier to work with Git in the context of Android. The repo command is an
 executable Python script that you can put anywhere in your path. In working
 with the Android source files, you will use Repo for across-network
 operations. For example, with a single Repo command you can download files
 from multiple repositories into your local working directory.
 .
 repo is an unusual tool because it downloads all of its own Python modules
 using GPG-signed git tags, and stores those files as part of the project that
 it is working with.  So this package just provides the wrapper script, which
 provides the GPG signing keys for verifying that the correct Python code was
 downloaded.

 "sql.[upstream version].standalone" will invoke a specific version of
 Oracle SQL Developer Command-Line, "sql.[upstram version]" will invoke
 either the standalone or bundled Oracle SQL Developer Command-Line version
 (in this order), while "sqlcl" (the recommended way) and
 "sqlcl.standalone" take advantage of Debian's alternatives system and,
 when left in auto mode, will always invoke the highest version installed.

 Maybe it was the fact that people got to blow away Nazis. Maybe it was the
 sheer challenge of it all. For whatever reason, Wolfenstein 3-D and Spear of
 Destiny, pioneered the first-person shooter genre and brought its legendary
 creators, id Software, worldwide notoriety and numerous awards. In fact, The
 Computer Gaming World Hall of Fame recognized Wolfenstein 3D as helping to
 shape the overall direction of the computer gaming industry.
 .
 Wolf4SDL is an open-source port of id Software's classic first-person shooter
 Wolfenstein 3-D to the cross-platform multimedia library "Simple DirectMedia
 Layer (SDL)" (http://www.libsdl.org). It is meant to keep the original feel
 while taking advantage of some improvements.
 .
 The wolf4sdl game requires additional data files which are not available
 under a free license and cannot be distributed by Debian. Thus, this package
 contains no data files, but current releases of `game-data-packager' are
 able to generate suitable data packages from the publicly available
 Wolfenstein 3-D shareware episode.
