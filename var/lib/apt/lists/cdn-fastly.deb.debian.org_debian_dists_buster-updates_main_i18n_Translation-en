 requests locally, ensuring that the most common source of round-trips are
 nearly reduced to zero.

 web servers) on machines without a direct connection to the Internet,
 such as mobile devices or computers behind restrictive firewalls.
 PageKite works around NAT, firewalls and IP-address limitations by
 using a combination of  tunnels and reverse proxies.

 Natively supported protocols: HTTP, HTTPS
