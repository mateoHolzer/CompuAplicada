Package: distributed-net
Description-md5: 477da522b2f82ac0fc58fa899167257f
Description-en: client to donate unused CPU cycles to distributed.net
 Donate your extra CPU cycles to a worthy cause!
 .
 distributed.net started in 1997 as a project whose purpose was to win a
 series of contests sponsored by RSA Data Security Inc., to crack their RC5
 encryption by brute-force methods. These contests were meant to show
 governments of nations such as the United States, who limit exports or
 use of cryptography, that the standards allowed are too weak for general
 use.
 .
 Since this time, distributed.net's focus has changed from solely
 cracking RSA's RC5 and DES projects to working on more diverse
 distributed computing problems.
 .
 The ongoing projects are RC5-72 and Optimal Golomb Rulers (28-mark), the
 latter of which has practical applications in science. There are also a
 number of other projects which are either periodic or upcoming. You may
 choose which project you wish to participate in.
 .
 Installing this package will allow unused CPU cycles on your computer to
 contribute to cracking the code. There should be no noticeable slowdown of
 your system, since the client runs niced, and only uses CPU time when
 your computer would otherwise be idle.

Description-en: Cisco 7200/3600/3725/3745/2600/1700 Router Emulator
 Dynamips emulates Cisco 7200/3600/3725/3745/2600/1700 Routers on a traditional
 PC.  You can use dynamips to create labs. It uses IOS Images (which are not
 part of this package). Of course, this emulator cannot replace a real router.

Description-en: EMBOSS conversions of the programs in the phylip package
 This package is the adaptation of the PHYLIP package in which its
 programs can operate with the biological sequence formats and databases
 of the European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite (EMBOSS). The
 software packages adapted for EMBOSS are called EMBASSY.
 .
 PHYLIP (the PHYLogeny Inference Package) is a package of programs for
 inferring phylogenies (evolutionary trees). Methods that are available
 in the package include parsimony, distance matrix, and likelihood
 methods, including bootstrapping and consensus trees. Data types that
 can be handled include molecular sequences, gene frequencies,
 restriction sites and fragments, distance matrices, and discrete
 characters.
 .
 The EMBASSY PHYLIP programs all have the prefix "f" to distinguish them
 from the original programs and avoid namespace conflict.

Description-md5: a813c4019da545f80d6c517a0ad94817
Description-en: ICC color profiles for use with color profile aware software
 Color management allows controlled conversion between color representation of
 input and output devices and color spaces. ICC profiles are an important part
 of color management. They are data files that represent mappings between the
 input or output color space of a particular device and the device-agnostic
 profile connection space (PCS) in accordance with the standards set by the
 International Color Consortium (ICC). This package contains a number of high
 quality ICC color profiles for use with color profile aware software such as
 Scribus, Gimp, CinePaint, Krita, or Digikam. In general this package is
 useful if the software using it was built against a color management support
 library such as liblcms1 or liblcms2-2. In some software such as Scribus you
 have to explicitly enable color managemenent in the preferences to be able to
 use these profiles.

 DE6 is a male German diphone voice created in the context of the EU project
 NECA (IST-2000-28580), with the aim of being particularly suitable for the
 flexible synthesis of expressive speech.
 .
 The main feature of DE6 is therefore that it contains a complete diphone
 set for three different voice qualities defined by their vocal effort, low
 effort ("soft voice"), medium effort ("normal or modal voice"), and high
 effort ("loud voice").
 .
 This diphone database was recorded jointly by the Institute of Phonetics at
 Saarland University and by the Language Technology Department at DFKI,
 Saarbrücken.

Package: proj-rdnap
Description-md5: b1ed3fec9afe2c0e86deade1c0cdb406
Description-en: RDNAP grid correction files for PROJ
 Kadaster and Rijkswaterstaat CIV, working together under the name RDNAP,
 developed RDNAPTRANS™2008, the precise and official transformation
 between ETRS89 and the dutch national horizontal and vertical coordinate
 reference systems the Stelsel van de Rijksdriehoeksmeting (RD) and the
 Normaal Amsterdams Peil (NAP). A ‘simplified’ procedure has been
 developed which uses a NTv2-grid for the transformation between ETRS89
 and RD as well as a VDatum-grid for the transformation between ETRS89
 and NAP. This ‘simplified’ procedure has the following limitations:
 .
  1) The rdtrans2008 NTv2-grid can only give identical results to
     RDNAPTRANS™2008 within 1 millimeter at ground level onshore and at
     mean sea level offshore. The horizontal deviation is approximately
     1 millimeter per 50 meter height difference from ground level or mean
     sea level.
  2) An exception to 1) is the border of the RDNAPTRANS™2008 correction
     grid. Transformation results within cells of the rdtrans2008 NTv2-grid
     that are intersected by the border of the RDNAPTRANS™2008 correction
     grid can result in deviations of up to 20 centimeter.
  3) The naptrans2008 VDatum-grid cannot be used to determine deflections
     of the vertical. For this the NLGEO2004 geoid model has to be used.
  4) The naptrans2008 VDatum-grid is referenced to the Bessel-1841 ellipsoid
     and cannot be used stand-alone, it has to be used in combination with
     the rdtrans2008 NTv2-grid.
 .
 Taking into account the limitations listed above, the rdtrans2008 NTv2-grid
 and naptrans2008 VDatum-grid can be used as an alternative to
 RDNAPTRANS™2008 to transform geographic ETRS89-coordinates to
 projected RD-coordinates with grid correction applied and NAP-heights.
 .
 Note that, although the resulting RD/NAP and ETRS89 coordinates from the
 transformation will be correct, geographic Bessel-1841 coordinates will
 differ in both procedures and should only be considered as an intermediate
 result.

 Allows conversion to and from data in Javascript object notation (JSON)
 format. This allows R objects to be inserted into
 Javascript/ECMAScript/ActionScript code and allows R programmers to read
 and convert JSON content to R objects. This is an alternative to rjson
 package. Originally, that was too slow for converting large R objects to
 JSON and was not extensible. rjson's performance is now similar to this
 package, and perhaps slightly faster in some cases. This package uses
 methods and is readily extensible by defining methods for different classes,
 vectorized operations, and C code and callbacks to R functions for
 deserializing JSON objects to R. The two packages intentionally share
 the same basic interface. This package (RJSONIO) has many additional
 options to allow customizing the generation and processing of JSON
 content. This package uses libjson rather than implementing yet another
 JSON parser. The aim is to support other general projects by building
 on their work, providing feedback and benefit from their ongoing development.

 and other parameters of the model may be given and site-specific rate
 heterogeneity may also be incorporated in a number of ways. Any number
 of trees may be read in and the program will produce any number of data
 sets for each tree. Thus large sets of replicate simulations can be
 easily created. It has been designed to be a general purpose simulator
 that incorporates most of the commonly used
 (and computationally tractable) models of molecular sequence evolution.

 SiSU is a lightweight markup based, command line oriented, document
 structuring, publishing and search framework for document collections.
 .
 With minimal preparation of a plain-text, (UTF-8) file, using its native
 markup syntax in your text editor of choice, SiSU can generate various
 document formats (most of which share a common object numbering system for
 locating content), including plain text, HTML, XHTML, XML, EPUB, OpenDocument
 text (ODF:ODT), LaTeX, PDF files, and populate an SQL database with objects
 (roughly paragraph-sized chunks) so searches may be performed and matches
 returned with that degree of granularity: your search criteria is met by these
 documents and at these locations within each document. Object numbering is
 particularly suitable for "published" works (finalized texts as opposed to
 works that are frequently changed or updated) for which it provides a fixed
 means of reference of content. Document outputs also share semantic meta-data
 provided.
 .
 SiSU also provides concordance files, document content certificates and
 manifests of generated output.
 .
 man pages, and interactive help are provided.
 .
 Dependencies for additional features are taken care of in sisu related
 packages.
 .
 The dummy package sisu-complete together with sisu-markup-samples installs

Description-en: SmartLink software modem daemon
 The SmartLink modem daemon is the application part of the
 driver for recent modems produced by Smart Link Ltd.
 .
 This package replaces (along with hardware access drivers) the old
 driver generation (2.7.x) which consisted of kernel modules only.
 .
 It needs a kernel driver to access the hardware. This can be either
 recent ALSA (shipped with a newer kernel (>=2.6.4) with ALSA support
 and snd-intel8x0m module) which is sufficient for basic operation and
 data/Internet connection, or the SmartLink kernel driver which is
 provided by separate packages which you can build using the source from
 the sl-modem-dkms package.

Package: sl-modem-dkms
Description-md5: a58074862ac671ccf741dfee54f7b6e0
Description-en: SmartLink software modem driver - module building source

 software modems produced by Smart Link Ltd. It supports PCI and USB models.
 .
 In addition to this package, you will need the package sl-modem-daemon
 which implements the application part of the driver.
 .
 Module packages can be built for the custom kernel package either by hand or
 using DKMS.

Package: snaphu
Description-md5: 6ac13ac4c3384f0d55c3268461aa73d3
Description-en: Statistical-Cost, Network-Flow Algorithm for 2D Phase Unwrapping
 Two-dimensional phase unwrapping is the process of recovering
 unambiguous phase data from a 2-D array of phase values known only
 modulo 2pi rad.
 .
 There are many applications, like Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI),
 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), fringe pattern analysis, tomography
 and spectroscopy, which as part of their fundamental operation depend
 upon the extraction of a phase signal from their input image. Usually
 the phase is available in a form that suffers from 2-pi phase jumps
 due to the use of the mathematical arctangent function, which produces
 an inherently wrapped output. This wrapped phase is unusable until the
 phase discontinuities are removed.
 .
 SNAPHU is an implementation of the Statistical-cost, Network-flow
 Algorithm for Phase Unwrapping particularly suitable for SAR
 interferometry applications. This algorithm poses phase unwrapping as
 a maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimation problem, the
 objective of which is to compute the most likely unwrapped solution
 given the observable input data. Because the statistics relating the
 input data to the solution depend on the measured quantity, SNAPHU
 incorporates three built-in statistical models, for topography data,
 deformation data, and smooth generic data. The posed optimization
 problem is solved approximately with use of network-flow techniques.
 .
 As SNAPHU uses an iterative optimization procedure, its execution time
 depends on the difficulty of the interferogram. In single-tile mode
 the required memory is on the order of 100 MB per 1,000,000 pixels in
 the input interferogram.

Package: tome
Description-md5: 9efcf47839037501aa7357051f1287d3
Description-en: single-player text-based roguelike dungeon simulation game
 Tome, short for Troubles of Middle Earth, is a single-player,
 text-based, dungeon simulation derived from the game angband, which
 in turn is derived from the older game Moria, which was in turn based
 on Rogue. It is often described as a "roguelike" game because the
 look and feel of the game is still quite similar to Rogue.
 .
 In tome, the  player may choose from a number of races and classes
 when creating a character, and then "run" that character over a
 period of days, weeks, even months, attempting to win the game by
 defeating Morgoth, who lurks somewhere in  the depths of the dungeon.
 .
 The ultimate goal of the game is to develop a character strong enough
 to defeat Morgoth, who resides on dungeon level 100. Upon doing so,
 you will receive the exalted status of "winner" and your character may
 retire.
 .
 The first main difference from Angband a new player to ToME will need
 to be aware of is that it has implemented a skills based system where
 instead of the  adventurer automatically improving in their abilities
 as they become more experienced, they get 5 skill points to spend on
 their character's abilities and can therefore customise what type of
 character they play. See the skills help file for details
 .
 The second major difference is that the main dungeon from Angband has
 been split  into 4 "dungeons", each of which cover a different
 portion of the dungeon's  levels. Note that not all of the places are
 actually "dungeons" - some are caves, forests, etc.
 .
 The third main difference between Vanilla Angband and ToME is the
 difference  in character classes and races, as well as a very
 different  magic system. ToME also offers the player the ability to
 undertake a series of  quests. It is not required for any adventurer
 to undertake  the fixed  quests, but they can result in some nice
 rewards.
 .
 Morgoth was 'the Dark Enemy of Middle-Earth' during its First Age. He
 was banished by the Valar (offspring of Eru, "god" of J.R.R.
 Tolkien's world) at the end of the First Age and thus never appears
 in The Lord of the Rings, set during the Third Age. Sauron, who does
 figure into those tales, was the most powerful of his servants. Read
 Tolkien's 'The Silmarillion' for more on the legends of Middle-Earth.
 Angband is a reference to Morgoth's "prison of iron."

Description-en: Threaded USENET news reader, based on rn (4.0 beta test)
 trn is a threaded news reader with a long history, descended from Larry
 Wall's rn (part of the second generation of newsreaders).  It has a
 powerful full screen text mode user interface, where most actions are
 available at the press of a single key.  It is highly configurable.
 .
 This version of trn reads news from a news server via NNTP (the Network
 News Transfer Protocol).  You must have a news server available - large
 sites usually provide a site-wide server.
 .
 If you install a news server on your system (either containing just
 local newsgroups or with a partial or full USENET feed) you can
 configure trn to access it.  In this case you will also need to install
 an appropriate 'inews' package for local posting.
 .
 This is a separate package from trn because trn 4.0 has enough
 substantial changes in its default behaviour (for instance, the group
 selector is new in 4.0) that some users prefer to stay with an older
 version of trn.
